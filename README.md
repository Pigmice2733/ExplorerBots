# Explorer Bots

This is a repository for the Explorers to provide recources when working with their robots at home.

### Software

[Arduino Software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
Here is a link to the software download for Arduino.

### Programmming

To program the TB6612FNG I recommend using the Sparkfun library. There is one programming example attached here and others in the library.
Here is the hookup guide for the motor controller. This guide has all the information on the motor controller.

# Note
The robot only uses 15 jumper wires however they come in packs of 40. Make sure to buy two wheels. You will need 4 AA batteries, hot glue gun and some card board to build your robot. A computer is also needed to program the robot any OS will work.  
### Troubleshooting

* Make sure your batteries are in correctly
* Powered on
* Wires are defined to the right ports
* Arduino is set to Arduino Nano (set to Arduino uno by default)
* Correct Port for Upload to Arduino
