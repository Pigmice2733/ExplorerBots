![assembled robot](https://github.com/Pigmice2733/Scout-CAD/blob/master/images/robot-fusion.PNG)

This is the CAD for our fisrt educational robot. I designed the robot in Fusion 360 and converted the model to Solidworks. The full assembly is in the .step format. 

| Part Color | Solidworks File |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Purple | wheel.SLDPRT |
| Red | top.SLDPRT |
| Green | chassis.SLDPRT |
| Yellow | 0.28.SLDPRT |

The whole Solidworks assembly is saved as Robot V17.SLDASM
